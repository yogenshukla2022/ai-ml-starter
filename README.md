This repository is a beginner-friendly starter template for building and experimenting with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) projects in Python. It provides a structured foundation with essential components already set up, so you can focus on model development instead of starting from scratch.

🔹 What this project includes

📂 Organized folder structure for datasets, notebooks, source code, and models

📊 Sample dataset and Jupyter notebook for quick experimentation

🧠 Example machine learning pipeline (data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction)

🛠️ Ready-to-use requirements.txt for environment setup

✅ Basic test cases to validate functionality

🔹 Why this project?

Getting started with AI/ML can be overwhelming due to scattered resources and setup complexity. This starter project solves that by providing a clean, modular, and extensible framework that can be easily adapted for:

Classification problems (e.g., spam detection, sentiment analysis)

Regression problems (e.g., price prediction, energy forecasting)

Time-series forecasting

Basic deep learning with TensorFlow / PyTorch

🔹 How to use

Clone the repository

Install dependencies from requirements.txt

Explore the sample notebook to understand the workflow

Replace the dataset and modify the pipeline to fit your problem

This repository serves as a launchpad for AI/ML projects—whether you’re learning machine learning concepts, prototyping an idea, or preparing for a larger research project.
